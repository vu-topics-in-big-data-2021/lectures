# Lectures - Topics in Big Data CS:4266/5266

The goal of this class is to cover the concepts and recent progress made in the area of the Big Data. The focus will be on principles and practices of data storage, data modeling techniques, data processing and querying, data analytics and applications of machine learning using these systems. Throughout the class you will learn about the applications of these topics in real-world cases studies such as public transit systems and Emergency Response Systems. Visit the following sites and look at the dashboards to see an example of how we use these techniques for some of our projects.

 # Expectations

 It is expected that the student taking this course is familiar with concepts like git, ssh and cloud computing. Also the primary programming language to be used in the course is python, which is one of the common languages used in data science and big data systems. Lastly, though we will use cloud computing resources for all assignments it is going to be important that you have a working computer with access to a terminal. As a starting point feel free to already install python 3.8 on your system. You can use anaconda if you are familiar it. But any other python3 environment will be okay.  Lastly, you will be assigned papers on some key topics and will be expected to read and present discussion on them during the class.

## Evaluation [Tentative]

The following grading criteria are tentative and are
subject to change. Each graded item in this course will be assigned a
certain number of points. Your final grade will be computed as the total
number of points you achieved divided by the number of points possible.
The instructor reserves the right to apply a curve to the final result.


## Grading Criteria [Tentative]

| Category        | Percentage  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Programming and Reading Assignments    | 40% | 
| Quizzes          | 20% |
| Mid Term Exam | 20%|
| Final Project       | 20% |



## Course Policies

Submissions will be due by midnight on the day mentioned in the assignment and homework description. Late submissions will be penalized with an automatic **20 percent penalty per day** (applied relative to the graded score for the submission).

## Disability Statement

Vanderbilt is committed to equal opportunity
for students with disabilities. If you have a physical or learning
disability, you should ask the Opportunity Development Center to assist
you in identifying yourself to your instructors as having a disability,
so that appropriate accommodation may be provided. Without notification,
your instructors assume that you have no disabilities or seek no
accommodation.

## Emergency Evacuation Plan

 This year the class is online and synchronous. If there is an emergency please inform the instructor and follow localized safety instructions applicable to your condition and scenario.
